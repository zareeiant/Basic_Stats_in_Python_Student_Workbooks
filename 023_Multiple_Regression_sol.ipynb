    "First, we'll get some data, and look at what the target and the features are going to be. This is a really simplifed example of some EDA that we normally do in advance of machine learning. The first step to any predictive model building is to look at our data and see if anything should be done prior to modelling. This is pretty vague, but we are basically looking to see if there's anything in the data that might be suboptimal for the predictions we want to create. Some common things to look for are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Errors - anything that is just \"wrong\", words in numeric columns, mislabeled values, etc...\n",
    "<li> Outliers - values too large or too small. \n",
    "<li> Weird Distributions - this is very open-ended, but think of something like a numerical feature where the variance is exceeding low. If every row of the data has the same value, it probably won't help in making predictions, which is inheirently seeking to discriminate. For example, some schools in Japan used to force students to dye their hair black if it wasn't already; if hair color was a feature in your dataset, it wouldn't really add any value if 99.9% of rows of data is \"black\". \n",
    "<li> Missing Values - how should we deal with it if some values are blank?\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't a conclusive list, and as we explore we may find other things to change or remove. The amount of work we may need to do can also vary widely - if the data is comming from something like a PoS system it will probably be pretty clean and not require many changes; if the data is coming from scraping social media sites from that people fill out, the data may well require massive amounts of cleaning.

In a 2 feature regression, the same idea applies, only we do the lookup with two X values on a plane and the prediction is where they intersect on the 3rd axis:\n",

    "## Multicollinearity - Useful, but Less Critical\n",
    "\n",
    "For fun, we'll look at the multicollinearity, because it is crazy high in this example. Look back at the pairplot, most varaibles appear highly correlated with each other - as one increases, the other does as well. This makes sense logically, as these are all measures of the body size; as your wrist size increases, so does your forearm, and your bicep, etc... They are closely correlated. One effect of this is that the impact of each variable is hard to pinpoint, as all the varaibles are largely measuring the same thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing this won't make our accuracy measures get way better, but it will allow us to better attribute the impact to the individual features, which is one advantage to a linear regression - that table of results give us some data that we can use to edit our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the VIF - variance inflation factor. This is a measure of multicollinearity. The calculation is VIF = 1/(1-R2), so as R2 gets closer to 1, the VIF gets larger. If we think of it in R2 terms - a big R2 indicates that a large percentage in the varaince of the results is captured in the model. Here, the R2 is how much of the variance of the other features is explained by each feature. So if they are higly correlated that value will be high and R2 will be high, leading to a big VIF value. If the R2 is low, then the varaible doesn't capture varaiance in the other features, so it is different from them, or it captures different data. In this case the R2 is small, so the VIF is small. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rule of thumb is that a VIF of ~10 should be looked at. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance Varies\n",
    "\n",
    "One way that makes a lot of sense to me to think of in this case, R2, and a few other places is to think of a measure of how much the data varies, and what is \"causing\" that varaince - as an intuitive sense, not a literal causitive relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we can start with the assumption that the target varries - it literally just takes on different values. \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> If we look back to R2, that's a measure of how much of that variance is captured in the model - or put in this context, the target varries a bunch, and R2% of that variation is \"caused\" (or captured by, more accurately) the things that we have in our model, and (1-R2%) is due to other stuff - whatever our model is missing. A complete model captures most of the things that cause the data to differ - if we step back and think about it logically and not statistically, this makes a lot of sense to me personally. \n",
    "<li> If we look at ANOVA (the f-score in particular) what we are looking for is a measure of what varies more. Do we see more change (variance in the data) when comparing two groups, which is an indication that the groups are different, or do we see more change when comparing the values inside of a group (indicating the groups are more similar). \n",
    "<li> Here, we are ultimately looking to attribute the varaiance in the target to the set of features that really matters. When measuring the VIF, we are basically asking the question, \"does the data still vary just as much without this varaible?\" If we have a high VIF that tells us that this varaible doesn't really \"add any information\" - the data varies almost/just as much with it gone, so it wasn't a determinative factor in making the data change. If the VIF is low, that tells us that the amount the data changes (varies) is dependent on this varaible - it contains information that makes the data change.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this is a mental model that makes sense to me, it is not a specific calculation or rule. On the whole, in predicive analytics, we are attempting to determine \"what causes this data to vary\", so we can use those things to make a prediction. The more of that varying we capture, the better we generally do. We can also look backwards, like we are here, and attempt to attribute that varaiance we see to different \"causes\", so we can do stuff like remove the ones that aren't making that much of an impact.

We'd expect the measurements to all be pretty correlated - it'd be a bit odd to have a huge wrist and a tiny ankle, or a big thigh and tiny knee. A few people might stand out, particularly very muscular people, but most people will be pretty consistent between every measurement based on fat level. \n",

Similarly, if we had massive amounts of data and training our model or storing the data was costly, being able to be accurate with less data is good.
