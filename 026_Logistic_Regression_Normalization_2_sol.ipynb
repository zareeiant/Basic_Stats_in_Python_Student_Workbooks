To some degree it is up to you exactly how you manage things like this, I personally like to keep data in a dataframe until we need to do the x/y split, then put the data into the two arrays. This will generally work with anything we use, so I don't need to worry about adjusting. You don't have to follow that, so if some other method makes sense, go for it. "

This can help guide us in looking at which features are important in making a prediction and which are not. \n",

For this linear regression model we can see that right now the SkinThickness, Insulin, and DPG may be candidates for being the least significant contributors. This does not automatically translate to just removing everything with a p-value < .05 and calling it a day. We'll look at some consdierations for selecting varaibles as we work through the ML stuff, but some things that we've looked at that might complicate this are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> The explained varaince - the R2. Recall that our goal is to capture as much of the information that defines how the target varies as possible. Suppose we have a model with 5 features - 4 of them providing the predictive value and one less important. Think of a model to predict how good a teacher is - the target might be \"test results\", and the features might be \"hours creating course material\", \"years of experience\", \"knowledge of material\", \"quality of assignments\", and \"color of whiteboard marker used\". In this example, the color of whiteboard marker can make a difference, I can definitely recall classes where it was hard to read the board, especially if you need glasses. However, this is only a small factor. If this model exists, the whiteboard marker color would probably have a small p-value, as it is not that impactful; however, it stil has some importance, and adds some value, just much less than the other ones. Removing this doesn't make our model better at predicting, it just makes it more compact - we would have to balance between those two. \n",
    "<li> In general, unless a variable is \"bad\" (confounding data), removing it probably won't make accuracy leap. \n",
    "<li> Different models will react differently. These linear models capture linear relationships, other models can capture different relationships, so if the feature set changes, there might be totally different impacts on different models. This is generally not something we can predict all that accurately in advance. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is a big topic and we'll revist it as we go. For now, we can use our tool of the p-value to rank variables in terms of their importance, and remove ones in that order if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note on collinearity:</b> if we flash back to collinearity we saw that sometimes we have variables which all contribute the same information to the model. If that is the case, this p-value for importance is somewhat random as the model can't accurately attribute importance to each varaible, since each is offering the same information there's no way to split that. For example, if a model predicted pant size, based on thigh size, knee size, and calf size,  the p-values between those 3 features would be unreliable. Which one is important in that prediction? We don't know, so which one has a higher or lower p-value doesn't matter. If we cut the collinear values first, then there is only one varaible measuring \"leg size\", so any variation of pant size predictions due to the leg size, is due to the one variable that remains. "

These values are \"logged\", then the negative average is taken (the logs are negative), and that's the metric for loss - or how bad the predictions are. Less loss, more accuracy. "

Scaling can sometimes cause problems with the relative impact of different ranges distorting calculations. Small values can be \"drowned out\" by larger values. \n",

    "Feature scaling can improve predictive accuracy, sometimes dramatically. Scaling data is not super impactful in some calculations (linear regression, trees) and it can (can - not will) be very impactful in others (logistic regression, gradient descent, neural networks, PCA). In general, when we have an algorithm that is adjusting itself to try to find the most accurate solution (e.g. log. reg. with gradient descent), scaling the data helps and is pretty standard. When we get to things like neural networks later on, it is just part of the process. \n",

    "<li>Standardization: distributions are normal(ish). \n",

Here, we can use it to string together the scaling and the model; in other models we might add a step to deal with missing data (impute), perform encoding (like the one-hot get_dummies), or any number of steps.
