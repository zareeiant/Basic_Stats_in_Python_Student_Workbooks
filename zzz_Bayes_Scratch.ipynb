    "# Naive Bayes - From Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "We can expand on the the idea of Bayesean updates with multiple features into a full predictive model. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Parts of the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Our predictive model needs to do a few things. The main conceptual difference between this model and doing the Bayes tables is that here we will pre-calculate all of the potential calculations of likelihood that we may need. In the tables, every time we saw a new feature we then calculated its likelihood and updated our probability with it when we did the update to generate the unnormalized and posterior probabilities. Here we will pre-calculate each of those likelihoods ahead of time in the fitting step, so when a prediction needs to be made we can just look up the matching likelihoods and do the multiplication to calculate the answer. Doing it like this means all of the heavy lifting (calculating all of the probabilities) is done while fitting, and creating predictions is fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "The initialization step will just setup the pieces that we'll need. Here our initialization declares empty varaibles that will hold everything we calculate and figure out. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Train the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process is where the model is \"built\", or where it learns all of the information it needs to be able to make predictions. This is the majority of the work. In short, we need to:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Create a list of all the features in our data. \n",
    "<li> Create a list of all of the likelihood possibilities. \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> This is a list of all the potential feature_outcome pairs that is possible. \n",
    "    <li> \n",
    "    <li> The format, with an underscore between the feature and value is arbitrary - we are only creating a replicable item to represent that combination, it could theoretically be anything. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Calculate the actual likelihood probabilities. \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> For each of the possible likelihoods, calculate its actual likelihood value. \n",
    "    <li> I.e. what is the actual probability of playing golf given that it is sunny.\n",
    "    <li> This is the \"flipped conditional\" part of the Bayes equation. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Calculate class prior probabilities. \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> This is the other part of the numerator in the Bayes equation. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Calculate the prior probabilities for the features. \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> How likely is each potential value for each feature. \n",
    "    <li> Used for the bottom of the Bayes equation. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once done training, no matter what our data actually says, we should have all of the probabilities for it pre-calculated in one of our data structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Predict\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a prediction we just need to look up the correct probabilities, and perform the calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Bayes Note\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem that can occur with Bayes is the \"zero count\" problem, or what if we have a valid value for one of our features that just doesn't occur in our training data. For example, what if there was a day that we were predicting with our weather and golf model where the Humidity was \"Dry\"? When we attempt to look up the probability of \"Humidity = Dry\" there won't be anything there and the probability will be 0, since we didn't train for it. Since this will popup on the bottom of the division in the equation, that'll be an issue. This problem is resolved through something called Laplace (or Additive) Smoothing. We won't implement this immediately here (maybe next week? maybe for a fun weekend exercise?) but the idea is relatively simple - when calculating the probability of something, rather than doing the normal calculation of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(A) = \\frac{count-of-A}{total-elements} $\n",
    "\n",
    "We change that to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(A) = \\frac{count-of-A + alpha}{total-elements + (alpha*number-of-features)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Where alpha is a chosen constant, usually 1. We'll look at how to choose a good alpha when we look at tuning models, the short answer is guess and test. \n",
    "\n",
    "This smoothing correction seves to make sure that our model can handle new values without just failing, at the expense of a very minor impact to accuracy on predicted probabilities for things we do know. If a new unseen value comes in, rather than it's probability being 0, which will cause the overall cacluation to fail, its probability will be some small value - almost certainly unlikely to make a tangible difference in our calculations, but enough to keep things rolling. In other words we've sacrificed a tiny bit of accuracy in exchange for much more generalizability. With datasets of a reasonable size, the small additions of the smoothing calculation don't make much of a difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a perfect world, where we knew every possibility ahead of time and had it embedded in our training data, this smoothing would not be useful and we would not consider it. In reality, Bayes is often used for things like spam detection, where the incoming features are words from the text of an email - in such a case, it is very likely that we will encounter new things when making predictions, so this smoothing is used very frequently when using a Naive Bayes model. \n"

    "Below we have most of the Naive Bayes algorithm. The \"real\" ones from sklearn or other packages are basically the same as this - normally just with slightly better error handling, a few more options, and maybe some optimizations for speed - but the idea and execution is almost the same. One change that is actually different in ours is that we are using data in its dataframe format within our algorithm. This is a relatively minor change, and doesn't change any of the concepts behind what we are doing, what it does is make the code a little easier to read and understand as humans, as we can use things like the dataframe's \"columns\" variable. An implementation using arrays (to work exactly like the sklearn ones) would be almost the same, but places where we refer to columns by names would be replaced by indicies. (In practice, many of the functions can take anything that is \"iterable\", or can be iterated over one object at a time, like a dataframe, array, or list: https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Iterables.html)\n",

    "## Bayes Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see here, Bayes works totally differently from a logistic regression, even though it performs the same work. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few stipulations to using Naive Bayes, and a few varieties made to deal with scenarios that don't meet those stipulations:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Naive Bayes only works with categorical features. \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Other versions of Bayes, such as Gaussian Bayes, allow numerical features to be used. For the Gaussian version, the probabilities are basically changed from the counting we did here, to probability estimates from a normal distribution. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Normalization isn't relevant to Naive Bayes. \n",
    "<li> Encoding categorical varaibles isn't required. \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Note:</b> this is generally true for the algorithm itself, but implementations of NB that you <b><i>might</i></b> use may require numerical inputs. That's a choice whoever made the library made in the design, NB handles categorical strings fine by default. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Naive Bayes makes an assumption of independance between each feature, or that one feature's value does not impact another feature. This assumption is often not totally true in the real world (e.g. sunny and hot may tend to come together). The more independent the varaibles are from each other, the more reliable the results will be. \n",
    "<li> Naive Bayes can produce multinomial predictions (predicting between more than 2 classes) very easily. Our model above does it by default - each outcome has a probability of occuring, and the most likely one wins. \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> We will look into multiple class predictions more in the ML class, they are not always as simple as they are with Bayes. \n",
    "    <li> Each outcome is basically one row of a Bayes table, and we can handle 3+ with no real changes. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayes Uses and Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes models are often used in things like spam detection. Naive Bayes can handle text inputs, and it is very fast to calculate, so that is an ideal scenario for the strength of the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes is also very simple and transparent, we can see exactly how decisions are made by the algorithm. This is also true for the regression algorithms we looked at, but it is not universal. "

    "#### Data Prep\n",
    "\n",
    "The data has two things, the make and gear_box, that are categorical values, represented by numbers. We know this is fine, but we do need to check the data type and make sure that this is somehting that python will treat as a categorical value when processed. The most simple way to address that is to just make them strings, which I did below. There's probably several things you could do to these values to make them work, it really doesn't matter much - making it a string will tell python to treat it like other strings, which gets the job done. \n",

    "We can use our model almost exactly the same as we use any others. We can mix it in here with the train-test split, and the accuracy score functions from sklearn. The interchangeability that we have with the sklearn stuff carries through most areas, and makes it convinient for us to try new things without needing to learn a lot of specifics about each possible function. \n",

    "\n",
    "For this one we have a few things to watch out for when making predictions. The main thing is that we don't have anything in place to handle the zero probability problem. To avoid this, I tested it and set the random state arguments in the random bits - that should ensure that the randomness is always the same, so if it worked for me once, you should get the same splits. We also have a large dataset and a small test split, so the odds of getting one of those is pretty low. If you dropped the random state argument, it <i><b>could</i></b> happen, and you could get an error. The probability is low and it is random, so the odds are it will still work. At any point in time it might fail though. \n",
    "\n",
    "I've also added a stratify argument to the train-test split, that tells it to make sure that each class in y2, the target varible, is represented in each of the training and testing dataset in roughly equal proportions. "
