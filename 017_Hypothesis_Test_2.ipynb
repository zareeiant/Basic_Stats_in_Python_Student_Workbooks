    "<li>False Negative - The effect is significant, and we've considered it a due to chance. (Type 2, beta)\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "The false positive rate is pretty simple - the threshold rate (commonly .05). We are defining a cutoff at the threshold value - a 1 in 20 criteria means that we expect 1 out of 20 tests to be incorrect - false positive. See book pg 130 for details on how we could show this with CDFs. \n",

This p-value doesn't tell the whole story though, what if we have errors in the other direction - we have differences that do matter, but are being identified as random.

If we count up the actual rolls, we observe a difference in counts, this is shown in the observed list.
