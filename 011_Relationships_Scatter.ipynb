    "\n",
    "The pairplot is a very helpful tool when looking at distributions and correlations of several variables in a dataset all at once. The pairplot can often be something of a one stop shop for getting a quick preview of our data. Pairplots are also very easy to create, we basically just need to supply the dataframe of data and the function will do the rest. We can also specify color coding, and the graph will automatically split the data for us. This is ver useful later when doing machine learning, as we can split the data on the target (goal) variable; for example, if we had data to predict if someone was a customer or not, we can split the data by that customer varaible, and the patterns in the data would highlight if there appears to be a difference between the two groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "The seaborn documentation page on pairplots is here: https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> For most of the things here, functions like a pairplot will automatically use the numeric columns of data and ignore the non-numeric ones. A .info() call can help identify if any are mislabeled. Then an .astype() can force it. This is often cause due to a non-numeric value in a numeric column, so you may find a need to filter the data sometimes, .to_numeric() can also help here, Google for its options. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note 2:</b> This is one thing that can take a long time, especially if you have lots of data. Some things to speed it up are to ensure that any columns that you don't want/need are dropped, as well as taking a sample to plot (.sample(X_rows_to_sample)). In cases with a lot of data it is common to take a sample to run trials with, since it is faster, and drawing conclusions from that smaller sample. If we have millions of rows of data it may be impractical or impossible to do stuff like this with all the data, if we take a sample of 10,000 or so rows that will show the distributions and correlations fine, so we can build up our work from the sample, then when we get to the ends we can utilize all of the data. This type of process is very common later on in machine learning, especially when dealing with \"big data\" scenarios. The sample is \"good enough\" to work from, so we can save some time. "

The details of skew calculations is well beyond the level of detail we have to care about here, but long-story-short, there are several calculations of skew: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness. The Pearson Median Skew is one that attempts to be \"non-parametric\", or one that does not make assumptions about the distribution of the underlying data. Below, we can calculate it along with \"regular\" skew. This is another example of the usefullness of normality, the other skew calculations lean on assumptions of the normality of the data - from the wikipedia page, \"Under the assumption that the underlying random variable {\\displaystyle X}X is normally distributed...\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The parametric vs non-parametric idea is one that will stick with us. If we can assume that the data matches a distribution (usually normal) closely enough, then we can use things \"built upon\" that assumption - like some skew calculation. If it doesn't match that distribution, we need a different approach. There's a trade-off between durability (the ability to be used on any dataset), and suitability (the ability to tailor the results to our exact example). \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> We will generally stick with the thinkstats calculations of skew, since it makes it much easier to work with textbook stuff. We don't really have scenarios where you'll need to choose between skews calculations and have the results matter. Being aware that we can calculate skew differently is sufficient. In practice, if you needed to do this in real life, you'd probably use the scipy one. "
