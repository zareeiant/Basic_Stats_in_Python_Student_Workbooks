    "\n",

    "<li> An indication of the \"event\" - whenever the survival thing happens. E.g. death, a customer leaves, a lightbulb fails. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a dataset that shows us how long until an event happens for the records in our sample, we can create a distribution from that data to estimate the time to event, and we can do some manipulations of that data to create some survival specific tools and techniques. A\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do some univariate survival analysis, or we will use one variable - the time somemthing lasts. The event varaible is more of an indication that the time something lasts is now over, it isn't really it's own feature. It is possible, though a bit more complex, to do survival analysis with a larger feature set, just like regression/classification. The lifelines package referenced near the bottom of the workbook provides some tools for this, we <i>may</i> get into it during the ML stuff, largely dependent on what we need to cover for your project work.

For example, the hazard function will show: of all employees that lasted 24 months, how many ended their employment in that month.

    "\n",
    "In real usage, we generally don't have all data in a nice CDF of our population ready to go, in particular we often want to do this analysis before we have a substantial number of \"events\", or before many of the things have not survived. We can call data such as the still-alive people in a drug trial data that is censored - we don't know the actual true value. We need to make an estimation of the survival and there is a method to do so - Kaplan-Meier Estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "KM is a commonly used function that we can use to estimate a hazard and survival function from some data. The formula (which we don't need to worry about in detail) is:\n",

    "One concept that also comes up when looking at survival is the idea of censored data - in short, censored data is data that we don't have \"all\" of. Specifically in survival analysis, censored data is any data for which we do not know the exact event time. There are three types of censored data; right censored, left censored, and interval cesored. Data for which the exact event time is known is referred to as complete data. In general, our concern with censoring will be right censored data, generally due to items where the event hasn't happened yet. For things like a drug trial, if we are tracking how long patients live, we (hopefully) have a bunch where we don't know the true answer, because they are still alive, we jst know they lived \"at least up to this point\". In general, this type of data is common for things that use survival analysis - think about a drug trial, if the drug works, we probably don't want to wait 70 years for everyone involved to die before being able to analyze the data and approve the drug. As well, people will commonly do things like stop working with the people conducting the trial, move away to a different city, etc...\n",

    "\n",
    "For us, we will not be doing extensive survival analysis, so it is good enough to be aware of what censored data is, should it become important for something you may be working on. The KM estimation is able to produce estimations that account for the right censored data that we often get in survival analysis. Exactly how to handle censored data beyond this is generally a domain specific thing, depending on exactly what you're analyzing. \n",

In the \"guides\" folder of this repository there is a long document with examples of almost all the common things that we may want to do, the filename is \"survival.pdf\" and it is taken from: https://pub.towardsai.net/survival-analysis-with-python-tutorial-how-what-when-and-why-19a5cfb3c312 "
