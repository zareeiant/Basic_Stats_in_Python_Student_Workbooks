    "We'll need to use arrays for some things later on, we're looking at them here just to get an introduction. One cool thing about much of the functionality that we'll use is that many functions can accept data in many different formats - dataframes, series, arrays, lists, and more! All of these data structures have, to different degrees, overlapping characteristics - here the important characteristic is that they are all iterable, or they all hold things in something that can be treated like a \"list of things\". Because of this, we can feed in data that is in any of these data structures interchangeably and get the same results. We need to build our comfort level in using data that is stored differently. "
