    "In general, the approach we are taking is more directly transferable to data science, as we generally deal with datasets and counts of what happens in those datasets. There is another branch of statistics, Bayesian Statistics, that focuses on probability and solves the same challenges we are solving through that lens. We don't need to be experts in Bayesian Stats, but having some exposure to the probabilistic view will help our understanding. It will also likely help with our ability to deal with probability and stats in real life, as we often will see and use odds, probability, and summation when talking about real world events. As evidenced by the last few years, much of society really struggles with understanding the likelihood that something will happen. "
