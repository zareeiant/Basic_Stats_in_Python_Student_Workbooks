    "The book uses the forumla method for calling statsmodels, whereas when we did linear regression, we used the 'regular' way. For logistic regression, we can try using the formula here. As with linear regression, statsmodels gives us some more detailed data that we can look at to try to understand the effectiveness of the model, such as p values for each feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like linear regression, scikitlearn vs statsmodels vs any other library function is pretty much up to you. They do the same thing, so use what you please. SKlearn is a little more transferable to future uses in terms of mechanics. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the statsmodels formula, we can save a little bit of data manipulation in exchange for writing out the feature names. Most notably, we can keep the Xs and Y together in the data, then when we write the formula, that does the 'splitting'. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> like many functions, the train test split is able to handle data in different data structures. Here if we give it a dataframe it will allow us to keep the varaible names all the way through the statsmodels calculations. This is easy in this case because the x/y splitting in statsmodels is defined here by the formula, not the arrays we feed it. To some degree it is up to you exactly how you manage things like this, I personally like to keep data in a dataframe until we need to do the x/y split, then put the data into the two arrays. This will generally work with anything we use, so I don't need to worry about adjusting. You don't have to follow that, so if some other method makes sense, go for it. "

    "### Varaible Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the statsmodels results to get an evaluation of varaible importance. The p-value is a measure of the variable importance, and it works much like p-values do in general - if it is small, typically <.05, then the relationship is significant. This can help guide us in looking at which features are important in making a prediction and which are not. \n",
    "\n",
    "One note for this, and any other varaibel selection things that we look at is that they are not definitive and conclusive findings, they are indications. For this linear regression model we can see that right now the SkinThickness, Insulin, and DPG may be candidates for being the least significant contributors. This does not automatically translate to just removing everything with a p-value < .05 and calling it a day. We'll look at some consdierations for selecting varaibles as we work through the ML stuff, but some things that we've looked at that might complicate this are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> The explained varaince - the R2. Recall that our goal is to capture as much of the information that defines how the target varies as possible. Suppose we have a model with 5 features - 4 of them providing the predictive value and one less important. Think of a model to predict how good a teacher is - the target might be \"test results\", and the features might be \"hours creating course material\", \"years of experience\", \"knowledge of material\", \"quality of assignments\", and \"color of whiteboard marker used\". In this example, the color of whiteboard marker can make a difference, I can definitely recall classes where it was hard to read the board, especially if you need glasses. However, this is only a small factor. If this model exists, the whiteboard marker color would probably have a small p-value, as it is not that impactful; however, it stil has some importance, and adds some value, just much less than the other ones. Removing this doesn't make our model better at predicting, it just makes it more compact - we would have to balance between those two. \n",
    "<li> In general, unless a variable is \"bad\" (confounding data), removing it probably won't make accuracy leap. \n",
    "<li> Different models will react differently. These linear models capture linear relationships, other models can capture different relationships, so if the feature set changes, there might be totally different impacts on different models. This is generally not something we can predict all that accurately in advance. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is a big topic and we'll revist it as we go. For now, we can use our tool of the p-value to rank variables in terms of their importance, and remove ones in that order if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note on collinearity:</b> if we flash back to collinearity we saw that sometimes we have variables which all contribute the same information to the model. If that is the case, this p-value for importance is somewhat random as the model can't accurately attribute importance to each varaible, since each is offering the same information there's no way to split that. For example, if a model predicted pant size, based on thigh size, knee size, and calf size,  the p-values between those 3 features would be unreliable. Which one is important in that prediction? We don't know, so which one has a higher or lower p-value doesn't matter. If we cut the collinear values first, then there is only one varaible measuring \"leg size\", so any variation of pant size predictions due to the leg size, is due to the one variable that remains. "

    "### F1 Score\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one score that is pretty common that may be helpful  - the F1 score. The F1 score seeks to balance PRECISION (avoid false positives) and RECALL (target true positives, at cost of false positives). There's also a way (fbeta) to adjust the balance between recall and precision, but we'll set that aside for now. The f1 score is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ F1 = 2 * \\frac{(precision * recall)}{(precision + recall)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it is simple with an sklearn function. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Which One?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a metric other than accuracy will ultimately be defined by the problem being predicted. If there's no outside pressure, the overall accuracy and the F1 will probably be what we normally look at. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Side Note: Other Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the F1, I put in log-loss, which is another metric of accuracy. This one is commonly seen later on when doing neural network stuff. The idea is always the same - we want to find something that minimizes the amount of error. In a question on the credit card fraud I said that you may try to optimize for some other metric than raw accuracy - this is an example of one that is common. In short, you'll define a ML algorithm to use, then define a loss function (e.g. log-loss), and the algorithm will repeat trials (gradient descent) in an effort to minimize that \"loss\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Log Loss is the negative average of the log of corrected predicted probabilities for each instance. E.g. if a value is true, and a prediction is .8 probability, the corrected probability is .8; if a value is false and the prediction is .8 probability, the corrected proability is .2. These values are \"logged\", then the negative average is taken (the logs are negative), and that's the metric for loss - or how bad the predictions are. Less loss, more accuracy. "

    "# Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling includes several similar methods of taking numerical values and transforming them to be on a different scale. There are several, a few we'll look at right now are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Normalization - rescale the data so all values are between 0 and 1. \n",
    "<li>Standardization - rescale the data so there is a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "These all process our data in a similar way - taking the original data, and shifting its distribution using a transformation. The calculations for these scaling methods are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Normalization: x = ( (x-min(x)) / (max(x)-min(x)) ) \n",
    "<li>Standardization: x = ( (x-mean(x)) / (std(x)) )\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "![Scaling](images/scaling.png \"Scaling\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There are other feature scaling algorithms/methods, these are just the two more common ones. The idea is pretty much always the same. One other consdieration is how the scaling treats outliers, which we'll worry about more next semester. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Standardization - Normalization](images/norm_stand.jpeg \"Standardization - Normalization\")\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>OK.... Why?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling has several benefits, the impact of these benefits varies widely depending on the exact original data, and the type of models you're using. The reasons are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Scaling - different values may have widely different scales (e.g. if processing a loan, age and net worth will be very different). Scaling can sometimes cause problems with the relative impact of different ranges distorting calculations. Small values can be \"drowned out\" by larger values. \n",
    "<li>Range - similar to the scale problem, if data values are radically different, some calculations will become less accurate. This particularly can impact distance based calculations, like clustering. \n",
    "<li>Speed - with algorithms that use methods like gradient descent (like logistic regression), having values on different scales and ranges may cause the algorithm to take longer to converge on a solution, or potentially prevent it at all. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling can improve predictive accuracy, sometimes dramatically. Scaling data is not super impactful in some calculations (linear regression, trees) and it can (can - not will) be very impactful in others (logistic regression, gradient descent, neural networks, PCA). In general, when we have an algorithm that is adjusting itself to try to find the most accurate solution (e.g. log. reg. with gradient descent), scaling the data helps and is pretty standard. When we get to things like neural networks later on, it is just part of the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will do this pretty often in machine learning applications, similar to encoding categorical varaibles it is kind of a preparatory step that we just do without thinking much about it because it makes things work (or work better).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Which Scaler to Pick?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not generally a definitive answer to that, and the real answer is to try a few and observe the results in accuracy. We do have a few rules of thumb:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Normalization: distribution is unkonwn, things need to be 0 to 1. \n",
    "<li>Standardization: distributions are normal(ish). \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "For now deciding between the methods isn't a huge concern. If the features look normal, we'll try to standardize; if not, normalize. We can worry about some finer differences as they come up next semester. If in doubt, try each, check accuracy, choose the best. Outliers will impact each (think about why), so we probably want to deal with those prior to scaling. "

    "### Scaling Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the scaling, the distribution is the same for the data after the transformation, but the ranges are different. We can also see visually the impact of outliers here - we'd normally want to address those in advance. In extreme cases, having a massive outlier can \"squish\" all the data at one end of the distribution, which will be bad in most cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scaling Caveat\n",
    "\n",
    "One detail we've overlooked here is that the data should technically be scaler after the split of train/test data, and the scaler should only be trained on the training data (fit) and applied on the testing data (transform). This is to prevent any data leakage - the test data is supposed to be brand new, and if it is able to influence the scaling, then it has some impact on the training of the model. How much of an impact does this make? Probabaly not much for the vast majority of applications, but it is technically correct to keep 'em separated. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll do the below example with it scaled 'properly'. "

    "\n",
    "Luckily, we don't really need to bust out our algebra to build any of these calculations by hand, we can use some built in functions in scikit learn to do it for us. These functions can also be built into a pipeline to process data (next semester), so we can build this transformation in without really seeing the resutlts. Like encoding last week, this takes data that is readable, and makes it not readable - we can package all of those steps in with our modelling, so legible data goes in - a trained model comes out. \n",

    "We can use our pipeline to string the steps in our data prep together. In general, most of the sklearn functions that we may need can fit into these pipelines. Once the pipeline is made, it \"is\" our model - it will do whatever preparation steps we build into the list of actions. Here, we can use it to string together the scaling and the model; in other models we might add a step to deal with missing data (impute), perform encoding (like the one-hot get_dummies), or any number of steps. This allows us to build what is effectively a new model that contains both all of the data preparation and the modeling, all in one package. This is not required, but tends to make things more manageable. "
